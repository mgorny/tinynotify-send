.SH DESCRIPTION

.IP "\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-action\fR DESC:CMD"

Add an action running shell command \fICMD\fR. The command should be formatted
as for \fIsystem(3)\fR function. \fIDESC\fR specifies the command description
(which will be displayed by notification-daemon) and must not contain colons.

This option may be specified multiple times in order to specify multiple
actions.

.IP "\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-default\-action\fR [DESC:]CMD"

Set the default action. Syntax is similar to \fB\-\-action\fR, except for the
fact that \fIDESC\fR is optional and this option must be specified only once.
If \fICMD\fR contains colon, \fIDESC\fR must be specified explicitly (it can be
empty).

Note that notification-daemon may not display any description for the default
action.

.IP "\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-category\fR CATEGORY"

Notification category hint. This could be for example \fIemail.arrived\fR or
\fItransfer.complete\fR. For full list, see \fIDesktop Notification
Specification.\fR

.IP "\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-foreground\fR"

Force running in the foreground and waiting for notification-daemon to close
notification.

If not specified, @PROGRAM@ will daemonize whenever necessary.

.IP "\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-icon\fR ICON"

Application icon. This could be either an URI (with \fIfile://\fR schema)
or a name in a freedesktop.org-compliant icon theme.

.IP "\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-local\fR"

Send notification on the local session bus. This is the default in
\fItinynotify-send\fR.

.IP "\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-expire\-time\fR TIME"

Notification expiration timeout (in ms). If not specified, server-defined
default will be used. If \fI0\fR, notification does not expire.

.IP "\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-timeout\fR TIME"

Program run timeout (in ms). If not specified, defaults to expire-timeout
or 120s.

After that time, program will exit even if server doesn't signal
the notification being closed.

.IP "\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-urgency\fR LEVEL"

Urgency level for the notification (0 \- low, 1 \- normal, 2 \- critical).

.IP "\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-system\-wide\fR"

Send the notification system\-wide. This involves searching for all running
session buses, and sending the notification to all of them and thus requires
raised privileges. Default in \fIsw-notify-send\fR.

.IP "\-?, \fB\-\-help\fR"

Output short help.

.IP "\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR"

Output version information.
